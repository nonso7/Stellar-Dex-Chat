# FiatBridge Contract

A Soroban smart contract implementing a fiat-to-crypto bridge with deposit receipts, withdrawal queues, daily volume limits, oracle-based fiat caps, and a timelock admin system.

The diagram below illustrates the complete flow through the contract, split into the **user path** and the **admin path**.

## Error Code Reference

All errors are returned as `Result<_, Error>` variants. The contract uses a flat numbering scheme starting at 1.

| Code | Variant | Series | Description | Returned By |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | `NotInitialized` | Initialization | Contract has not been initialized (no admin set) | `withdraw`, `request_withdrawal`, `cancel_withdrawal`, `set_limit`, `set_cooldown`, `set_lock_period`, `transfer_admin`, `set_oracle`, `set_fiat_limit`, `queue_admin_action`, `execute_admin_action`, all view fns |
| 2 | `AlreadyInitialized` | Initialization | `init` was called on a contract already initialized | `init` |
| 3 | `Unauthorized` | Auth | Caller is not the contract admin | (reserved; auth enforced via `require_auth`) |
| 4 | `ZeroAmount` | Amount Validation | Amount is ≤ 0, or `init` called with `limit ≤ 0` | `init`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `request_withdrawal`, `execute_withdrawal` |
| 5 | `ExceedsLimit` | Amount Validation | Deposit amount exceeds per-token deposit limit | `deposit` |
| 6 | `InsufficientFunds` | Amount Validation | Contract balance is too low to fulfill the withdrawal | `withdraw`, `execute_withdrawal` |
| 7 | `WithdrawalLocked` | Withdrawal | Withdrawal request has not yet reached its unlock ledger | `execute_withdrawal` |
| 8 | `RequestNotFound` | Withdrawal | No withdrawal request exists for the given ID | `execute_withdrawal`, `cancel_withdrawal` |
| 9 | `TokenNotWhitelisted` | Token | Token address has no entry in the token registry | `deposit`, `set_limit` |
| 10 | `ReferenceTooLong` | Input Validation | Reference bytes exceed `MAX_REFERENCE_LEN` (64 bytes) | `deposit` |
| 11 | `DailyLimitExceeded` | Rate Limiting | Aggregate daily withdrawal volume exceeds the configured limit | (reserved for future daily withdraw cap) |
| 12 | `CooldownActive` | Rate Limiting | User deposited too recently; cooldown period has not elapsed | `deposit` |
| 13 | `NotAllowed` | Access Control | Allowlist is enabled and caller is not on it | `deposit` |
| 14 | `OracleNotSet` | Oracle | Oracle address is not configured, or oracle returned a non-positive price | `deposit` (via `validate_fiat_limit`) |
| 15 | `ExceedsFiatLimit` | Oracle | Deposit would push user's 24-hour USD volume above the fiat cap | `deposit` (via `validate_fiat_limit`) |
| 16 | `NoPendingAdmin` | Admin Transfer | `accept_admin` called but no pending admin was set | `accept_admin` |
| 17 | `ActionNotReady` | Timelock | Timelock delay is less than `MIN_TIMELOCK_DELAY`, or execution attempted before `target_ledger` | `queue_admin_action`, `execute_admin_action` |
| 18 | `ActionNotQueued` | Timelock | No queued admin action exists for the given ID | `execute_admin_action` |
| 19 | `NoEmergencyRecoveryAddress` | Emergency | Emergency recovery address has not been set | (reserved for emergency recovery flow) |
| 20 | `InactivityThresholdNotReached` | Emergency | Admin inactivity period has not yet elapsed | (reserved for inactivity-triggered recovery) |
| 21 | `InvalidRecipient` | Withdrawal | Recipient address failed validation | (reserved for future recipient checks) |

### Error Series Summary

| Series | Code Range | Domain |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Initialization | 1–2 | Contract lifecycle |
| Auth | 3 | Authorization |
| Amount Validation | 4–6 | Amount checks |
| Withdrawal | 7–8 | Queue management |
| Token | 9 | Whitelist |
| Input Validation | 10 | Byte constraints |
| Rate Limiting | 11–12 | Deposit throttling |
| Access Control | 13 | Allowlist |
| Oracle | 14–15 | Price oracle / fiat limit |
| Admin Transfer | 16 | Two-step admin handover |
| Timelock | 17–18 | Admin action queue |
| Emergency | 19–20 | Inactivity recovery |
| Future / Reserved | 21 | Planned extensions |

## CI Doc-Check

A GitHub Actions step validates that the error table stays in sync with the contract source. Add the following to your CI workflow:

```yaml
- name: Check error code docs are up-to-date
  run: |
    # Extract error variant count from lib.rs
    CONTRACT_ERRORS=$(grep -c '= [0-9]\+,' stellar-contracts/src/lib.rs)
    # Extract row count in the error table (lines starting with | followed by a digit)
    DOC_ERRORS=$(grep -cP '^\| \d+' stellar-contracts/FIAT_BRIDGE_README.md)
    echo "Contract errors: $CONTRACT_ERRORS, Documented errors: $DOC_ERRORS"
    if [ "$CONTRACT_ERRORS" != "$DOC_ERRORS" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: Error code count mismatch. Update FIAT_BRIDGE_README.md"
      exit 1
    fi
```
